The task is as follows: given the URL of an academic conference, you need to generate yaml metadata that captures basic information about the conference as well as the relevant deadlines for submitting to the conference. here are two examples:

For the USENIX Security conference whose website is: https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24

the desired yaml output is:
"""
- title: USENIX Security
  id: usenixsec24summer
  full_title: USENIX Security Symposium
  link: https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24
  deadline: '2023-06-06 23:59:59'
  timezone: Etc/GMT+12
  note: Summer Deadline.
  sub: [SEC]
  place: Philadelphia, PA, USA
  date: August 14-16, 2024
  start: 2024-08-14
  end: 2024-08-16

- title: USENIX Security
  id: usenixsec24fall
  full_title: USENIX Security Symposium
  link: https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24
  deadline: '2023-10-17 23:59:59'
  timezone: Etc/GMT+12
  note: Fall Deadline.
  sub: [SEC]
  place: Philadelphia, PA, USA
  date: August 14-16, 2024
  start: 2024-08-14
  end: 2024-08-16

- title: USENIX Security
  id: usenixsec24winter
  full_title: USENIX Security Symposium
  link: https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24
  deadline: '2024-02-08 23:59:59'
  timezone: Etc/GMT+12
  note: Winter Deadline.
  sub: [SEC]
  place: Philadelphia, PA, USA
  date: August 14-16, 2024
  start: 2024-08-14
  end: 2024-08-16
"""

for IEEE EuroS&P, the website is: https://eurosp2024.ieee-security.org/

the desired yaml output is:
"""
- title: IEEE EuroS&P
  year: 2024
  id: eurosp24
  full_title: IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy
  link: https://eurosp2024.ieee-security.org/
  deadline: '2023-10-30 23:59:59'
  note: Deadline for abstract registration. Paper deadline 2023-11-02 AoE.
  timezone: Etc/GMT+12
  place: Vienna, Austria
  date: July 8-12, 2024
  start: 2024-07-08
  end: 2024-07-12
  sub: [DS, SEC]
"""

thus, when multiple deadlines are provided, for instance one for abstract submission and one for full paper submission, use the first deadline, and specify in the note field the later deadline.
sort the fields of each yaml entry as above.
do not use the number of the occurrence of the conference or the year in the title or full_title.
make sure to specify the cycle in the note field and in the id.

when deadlines are in AoE = anywhere on earth, this corresponds to 23:59:59 in the most delayed time zone which is typically UTC-12 = Etc/GMT+12.

sometimes, the deadline information is not available on the conference's main website. in those cases, please find a link to the call for papers (CFP) on the main page, retrieve the CFP, and obtain deadline information from there.

understood?
